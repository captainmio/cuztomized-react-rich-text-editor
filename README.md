# Customized React Rich-text Editor

simple rich-text editor I created using react. Though I have to use a deprecated javascript(document.execCommand) to implementing RTE features(changing font colors, size, family, bold italic, etc...) as I cannot find any alternative to implement this features. I've included Typescript in this application but honestly, I am still learning things out with typescript, I am using the default setting in TS.

(Vite + React + TS)

## Setup

1. make sure you have npm installed in your local machine.

2. clone the repo to your local machine and run the following commands in the **command prompt**

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. You can now open the app thru a web browser (check cmd for the URL it will output)
